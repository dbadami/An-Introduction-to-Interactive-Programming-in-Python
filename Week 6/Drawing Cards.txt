Drawing the player's and dealer's hands. Some what of a template from the forums. 

def draw(self, canvas, p):
    '''draw this hand at p'''
    for i in range(len(self.hand)):
        # assign the card at position i to the variable "card"
        # assign the coordinates of this card to the tuple "pos"
        card.draw(canvas, pos) # draw this card

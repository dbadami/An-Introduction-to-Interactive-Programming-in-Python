##An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python
###Coursera - Rice University

I had taken this course during the last quarter of **2012** to learn programming and how to think like a programmer
in a more structured manner. These are my implementations to the weekly mini-projects that were required to be completed by enrolled students.
It should be noted that when I had completed the first offering, the course had encompassed Parts 1 and 2.

**Note**: *These are my own implementations; all code was written by me with the exception of the starter code provided for each project. I do not allow
anyone else to use these implementations are their own.* 

**Course Description**: 
This introductory course taught students the basics of interactive
 programming in Python. Students built a collection of simple
 interactive games to solidify their understanding of material.
